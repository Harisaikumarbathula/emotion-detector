- **/data**: Includes datasets used for training and testing the emotion detection models.
- **/models**: Pre-trained models and scripts for training new models.
- **/docs**: Documentation and resources related to the project.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Emotion Detector, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detector.git
    cd emotion-detector
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download pre-trained models**:
    Download the necessary pre-trained models and place them in the `/models` directory. Instructions for downloading the models can be found in the `docs` folder.

4. **Prepare the datasets**:
    Ensure that the datasets required for training and testing are available in the `/data` directory. You can find more information about the datasets in the `docs` folder.

5. **Run the application**:
    Use the provided scripts in the `/src` folder to run the application. For example, to run the text-based emotion detection:
    ```sh
    python src/text_emotion_detector.py
    ```

6. **Explore other features**:
    You can also run the speech-based and image-based emotion detection scripts similarly:
    ```sh
    python src/speech_emotion_detector.py
    python src/image_emotion_detector.py
    ```

7. **Real-time emotion analysis**:
    For real-time emotion analysis, follow the instructions provided in the `docs` folder to set up and run the real-time analysis scripts.
